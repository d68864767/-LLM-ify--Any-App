# LLM-ify Tool

LLM-ify is an open-source tool that uses large language models (LLMs) to interpret natural language queries and output necessary library functions and code for app development. The tool is designed to work with open-source apps like Cal.com, NocoDB, OpenBB, Godot, RustDesk, and is also compatible with proprietary apps.

## Features

- Natural Language Processing: LLM-ify uses LLMs to understand and process the input queries.
- Domain-Specific Knowledge Bases: LLM-ify integrates knowledge bases for each target application, including documentation and code repositories.
- Code Generation: LLM-ify translates the processed queries into specific code snippets or configurations.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LLM-ify.git
```
2. Install the requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the main file
```
python main.py
```

## Usage

To use LLM-ify, simply input your natural language query and the tool will output the necessary library functions and code for your app development.

## Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:
```
python test.py
```
